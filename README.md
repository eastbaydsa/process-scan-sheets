# Scan Sheet Processing

NationBuilder requires that scan sheets be uploaded as [300 DPI monochrome TIFF images](https://nationbuilder.com/how_to_use_scannable_sheets#scan). This repo includes a script that processes images into a format that can be uploaded to NationBuilder.

NOTE: only macOS is supported.

1. Add raw images to `input` directory
2. Run the command `./process` in the Terminal
3. Output is in the `output` directory!
